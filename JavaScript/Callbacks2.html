      # Example: Order tracking status for food ordered online
        - Instantly: Order confirmed ✅
        - After 2 seconds: Order is being prepared 🍲
        - After 10 seconds: Order prepared 🎉
        - After 5 seconds: Order handed over to the delivery person 📦
        - After 3 seconds: Order is on the way 🛵
        - After 8 seconds: Order has reached it's destination 📍
        - After 4 seconds: Order has been delivered 😋

        - Total time for processing order: 32 seconds

      # Callback Hell (Pyramid of doom): The structure formed when a callback function is within another callback function and the pattern continues ...
        - Hence, the alternative approaches of handling asynchronous code can be used like 'promises' and 'async await'
