          - Resolves when all the promises are resolved
          - Rejects when any one promise is rejected
          - Syntax:
            Promise.all([promise1, promise2, ...])
              .then(() => {})
              .catch(() => {})

          - Additional pointers:
            - Total time taken to resolve = Time taken by the promise which takes the largest time to resolve
            - Total time taken to reject = Time taken by the promise which takes the least time to reject
            - Resolved result = Array of resolved results of individual promises
            - Rejected result = Result of the first rejected promise

        - any:
          - Resolves when any one promise is resolved
          - Rejects when all the promises are rejected
